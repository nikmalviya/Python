polymorphism means that an object of sub class can be passed to parameter of super class file a method may be implemented in several in several classes along the inheritance chain python decides which method is invoked at runtime this is known as dynamic binding

four special methods corressponding to object class
1 -> __new__()
this method is automatically invoked when a object is constructed this method then invokes init method to initialize the object generally one should only override the init method to initialize the data fields defines in class 
2 -> __init__()
3 -> __str__()
the string method return the string description of the object 
by default it returns a string consisting of class name of which the object is instance and the objects memory in hexa decimal format
4 -> __eq__()
this method returns true if two objects are pointing to the same reference
